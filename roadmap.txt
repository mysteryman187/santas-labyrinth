--------------UAT]feedback

its still boring and needs morre player engagement

so we need to have a story of sorts

so sant falls out of the sliegh when you click on start
and he falls in the maze
and there is a popuip text then to explain "oh noes santa fell into the labyrinth, can you help him"
also signs feture might help
...we can pass 2 text params into the game for showing popup at start and end

nothing happens when you finish....yep text is about it

there shouold be some bad guys
so sant gets zelda style hearts
he glows red flashy when hit

there is an evil snowman who is randomly placed in the maze
he jjust patrols up and down a given area

Featgure...evil snowman!
and when the player is close he will follow...slower than the player
he jumps along ..each jump shakes the screen when he lands + makes a thwomp noise
... the closer the player is to the snowman ..the more screen shake on each land(shold not shake when nowhere near me/ should be a clue when near, but not visible)
...he can only hit you when he is jumping at yhou
..if yougo next to him he would jusst sort jump up and down and on the dow you ghets hit
... if you run out of hearts the level will restard
...for the ransdom levels..the snowman wil be placed in a corner without playrr or gift

performance stuff i could do...
make the sprites way smaller i.e the size they end up on the 1080 phone
avoid the atlas and also make those smaller when you extract them
less sprites:
- combine tiles into 4s?
- combine them into 1 big ass thing...
- or maybe just 9s?
- use TileSprite..not sure will work with iso though





// how to add gyro to phone...but it doesnt relly work i dont think..code works...just annoying concept!
// maybe better if it were a rolling moneyball style marble thing!...but code only really providing diections(axises)
if (this.gyro) {
            const { gyro } = this;
            if (gyro.beta > threshold || gyro.beta < -threshold || gyro.gamma > threshold || gyro.gamma < -threshold) {
                const { gamma, beta } = gyro;
                if (gamma < 0 && beta > 0) {
                    // go right
                    faceRight();
                    player.animations.play('walk');
                    player.body.velocity.x = velocity;
                } else if (gamma < 0 && beta < 0) {
                    // go down
